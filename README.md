ENTRANCE
=====

The main purpose of this project is to transfer 4 features to the arduino mega 2560.
to create a smart home system by integrating this project
We use Arduino IDE, Proteus while implementing it. arduino we made
from simulation with proteus after integrating its features
we spend

METHOD
======

The main flow of this project is explained as follows. arduino mega
Using the 2560 card, there are 4 hysteria requested from us.
we add.\
1. Want to add Fire alarm\
2. Whether to add motion detecting light system\
3. Want to add a Digital thermometer\
4. Whether to add Lock system.\
We can transfer these desired features to the Arduino board in the simulation in the proteus.
we add. then arduino IDE how to get each feature to work
We determine with After specifying these features, add these features to the arduino IDE.
We code using the necessary algorithms. Hex from compilation
We add the file to the file section of the card we will simulate.
thus simulating the smart home system in a virtual way on the proteus.
we can.\

EXPERIMENTAL RESULT
================

As a result of the proteus simulations I have done, how are the circuits
to be connected, which sensor elements will be fed from where, and which
I learned that I will reference file extensions as a result of these inferences.
I have fulfilled the 4 necessary hysteria and each element separately first and then
I combined them all into one file. Fire alarm
For if there is a fire, I make the c4 tune sound and fire
I continue for 10 seconds after it is interrupted, the same movement
If I see a movement on the sensor, I turn on the lamp and the movement
I turn off the lamp 10 seconds after it is cut off. simulation
The first thing I have to do when I start it is to enter the door lock of the house.
If I enter correctly I turn on the green light, otherwise the red light
I block the entrance to the house by burning. With a digital thermometer
I measure the temperature of the air if the temperature is above 30 degrees
that the temperature increases, if it is below 20 degrees, the temperature decreases
I write to the screen, in other cases, only the temperature of the environment
I am writing.

SUMMARY
====

Smart home systems protect us from external factors and accidents.
reduces the effect of fires with its control, takes precautions, again heat
We adjust the room temperature with the sensor, both financially and comfort.
positive effect on the situation. with encryption
we prevent others from reaching the places we want,
It provides protection from thieves and strangers with its sensor. This
It has more qualified houses, offices, vehicles, etc.
so that we can look at our lives more positively.

CONCLUSION
=====

As a result, embedded systems with such arduino features
we see that we can be used in many places, these uses are now
it has reached every part of our homes, we also use these features.
We built a smart home system using
we have completed.
